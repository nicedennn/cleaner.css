# cleaner.css

https://nicedennn.github.io/cleaner.css/

#### Cleaner.css is a tiny file to add to your project to clean stock inputs and buttons.

No blue glow or outline when the input is active or unpleasant gradient.
I made it for myself but maybe it could help someone else.

Just add the class "cleaner" to your input to clean it.

NB : Cleaner.css doesn't work on the "Checkbox", "Radio" and "Range" inputs, because they need an additionnal span etc to make a custom style.
